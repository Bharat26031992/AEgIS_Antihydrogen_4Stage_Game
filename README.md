# AEgIS: Antihydrogen Gravity Lab

An interactive web-based physics simulator and educational game based on the **AEgIS Experiment** at CERN, where players synthesize antihydrogen and measure its gravitational properties.

## 🎮 About the Project

This project brings the cutting-edge AEgIS (Antimatter Gravity Interaction Study) experiment to life through an engaging, browser-based simulation. Players take on the role of researchers in the AEgIS lab at CERN's Antiproton Decelerator, progressing through four challenging phases of particle physics experimentation.

### Educational Purpose
The game educates players about real antimatter physics, including:
- **Antiproton confinement** in Penning-Malmberg traps
- **Positronium production** via charge-exchange reactions
- **Doppler laser cooling** at extreme frequencies
- **Time-of-flight spectroscopy** for gravitational measurement

## 🎯 Gameplay Features
